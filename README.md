### Why?

DE has basically abandoned the API, after they changed how the `pop` data works on May 12 2019 they have not said a single word about it. The data was also multiple times just broken (missing entries, missing any data and some people reported the data repeating from last week) and it's it's pretty useless anyway so I decided that it's not worth my time.

### Alternative?
Check out [Semlar's site](https://semlar.com/), it's much more useful because it is based on the riven stats.

### Can I use your data? / Can I take over?

You are free to do with the code and data what you want (giving credit is appreciated).
